# f8a-server-backbone
Server backbone service based on a given stack components does two tasks.
 - Stack Aggregation
 - Recommendation

##### Stack Aggregation
Based on the contents of a given payload, it tries to aggregate the data from the Graph.
It then persists the data in the Database and returns a response.

##### Recommendation
Based on the contents of a given payload, it calls Kronos service and gets the recommendation in
terms of
- Outliers
- Alternate Components
- Companion Components

It then persists the above data in the Database and returns a response.

#### How to test:

*  `./runtests.sh`

* curl localhost:<SERVICE_PORT>/api/v1/readiness should return `{}` with status 200

### Footnotes

#### Coding standards

- You can use scripts `run-linter.sh` and `check-docstyle.sh` to check if the code follows [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) coding standards. These scripts can be run w/o any arguments:

```
./run-linter.sh
./check-docstyle.sh
```

The first script checks the indentation, line lengths, variable names, whitespace around operators etc. The second
script checks all documentation strings - its presense and format. Please fix any warnings and errors reported by these
scripts.

#### Code complexity measurement

The scripts `measure-cyclomatic-complexity.sh` and `measure-maintainability-index.sh` are used to measure code complexity. These scripts can be run w/o any arguments:

```
./measure-cyclomatic-complexity.sh
./measure-maintainability-index.sh
```

The first script measures cyclomatic complexity of all Python sources found in the repository. Please see [this table](https://radon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commandline.html#the-cc-command) for further explanation how to comprehend the results.

The second script measures maintainability index of all Python sources found in the repository. Please see [the following link](https://radon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commandline.html#the-mi-command) with explanation of this measurement.
